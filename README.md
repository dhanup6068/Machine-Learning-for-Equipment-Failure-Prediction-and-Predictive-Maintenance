Machine learning pipeline for predictive maintenance (PM)

Data Preparation and Sampling: 


The initial part involves preparing the dataset for training, testing, and validation. It starts by getting a unique list of machine IDs and then randomly assigning them to training, testing, or validation sets based on certain probabilities.

Feature Engineering: 


Various features are extracted from the dataset, including statistical measures like mean, median, min, and max, as well as changes over time. Categorical variables are encoded into binary dummy variables.

Model Training:


The balanced training dataset is used to train an XGBoost classifier. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to balance the dataset by oversampling the minority class.
Model Evaluation: 


The trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, AUC-ROC score, and confusion matrices. The confusion matrix helps assess the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Cost Analysis:


The costs associated with different types of prediction errors (false positives, false negatives) are calculated and aggregated by modeling group.

Fine-Tuning and Sensitivity Analysis: 

The model is fine-tuned by adjusting parameters such as the forecast window and cutoff probability. The impact of these changes on model performance and associated costs is analyzed.

Conclusion:


Based on the analysis, recommendations or further actions may be proposed, such as deploying the model in production, conducting additional experiments, or refining the model further.
This pipeline demonstrates a systematic approach to building and evaluating a predictive maintenance model, considering both predictive performance and economic implications.
